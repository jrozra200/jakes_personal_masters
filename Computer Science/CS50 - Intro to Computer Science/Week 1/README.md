# Week 1

## Lecture Notes

- **Correctness**: code needs to be correct
- **Design**: is your code efficient and well formulated?
- **Style**: punctuation, spacing, indentation, etc.
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: The program that interprets your 
code and changes it to 0s and 1s
    - visual studio
    - **compiler**: takes source code to 0s and 1s
- cli commands:
    - `make`: makes a c program; not a compiler - it finds the compiler for me
    - `rm`: removes a file
    - `ls`: lists files in a directory
- `c` commands:
    - `printf()`: to print to screen
    - `get_string()`: to get a string from user
